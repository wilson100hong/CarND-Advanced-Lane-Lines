    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is in , of the section *Compute camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients from chessboard images*.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the provided images in folder `camera_cal/` to compute camera matrix and get distortion coefficients. Since the provided images are chessboards from different view angle, Assume all corners in 3-D space are on the same plane z=0, with coordinate like (x, y, 0), and are stored in `objpoints`. Each corner have a corresponding 2-D coordinates (x', y') on the image, and can be detected by using `findChessboardCorners()` and then stored in `imgpoints`. Corners in `objpoints` and `imgpoints` can be related by using OpenCV `drawChessboardCorners()` method to get the distortion coefficients.\n",

    "\n",
    "**NOTE: I do perspective transform (unwarp) before creating thresholded binary image because bird-view image gives me better observation and visualization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I only use color threshol to produce binary image, the code is in section *Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image*. I use HLS color space L-channel (light) to extract white lane, and Lab color space b-channel to extract yellow lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried other color spaces, like RGB and HSV. I also try different combination of using gradients, like sobel on x, sobel on y, sobel on x-y weighting, sobel on direction. However, sobel seems perfome worse than simple color thresholding, at least in testing images because it will discard many pixels and cause the later polyfit not stable. You can take a look `color_experiment.ipynb` for the experiment outcomes.\n",

    "The code is in section *Apply a perspective transform to get birds-eye view*, I use `getPerspectiveTransform()` to get the conversion matrix from `src` region to `dst` region, and then apply the conversion matrix to `warpPerspective()` to get the unwarped image. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline do a pretty fine job for `project_video.mp4`. However, it behaves pretty bad for challenged one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cannot find white lanes when the camera is in high exposure (too bright)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It cannot detects huge turn (high curvature) lane well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1. I need to try other color & gradient methods to see whether white lanes can still be extracted even in high exposure. Maybe a comination in multiple color spaces with adpative sobel kernal might work, but this requires more research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2. Since I only use the most basic sliding window search, maybe we can use adpative window width / margin based on curvature. If curvature is high (sharp turn), we use wider window."
